## Project Materials

I will be using the <a href="https://github.com/bear/python-twitter">A Python wrapper around the Twitter API </a> to mine the data from the said twitter account.

Installation instructions can be found here <a href="https://github.com/bear/python-twitter#installing">https://github.com/bear/python-twitter#installing</a>. After installation, we need to obtain Twitter api keys before using the project's API's. Instructions can be found here (<a href="https://github.com/bear/python-twitter#api">https://github.com/bear/python-twitter#api</a>) for how to get the API keys and also how to initialize the library for usage.

I have included a function (tweet_miner.py)to help with mining the data in this proposal. The function mines the data, puts them in an array and returns the array. We can then store array content as a csv file.
